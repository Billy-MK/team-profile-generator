## Description

This project is intended to demonstrate our ability to utilize Object Oriented Programming to desgin a functioning application. The application takes user input using Inquirer, and returns an HTML page dynamically generated based on that input to show a number of employees. I also included a number of tests run using jest, to demonstrate the functionality of the application.

## Installation

Download all files, use npm to install inquirer, jest, and fs. Run index.js using your integrated terminal.

## Tests

The tests are included in the tests folder, and can be run in integrated terminal using "npm run test". The Jest package is used to run all the tests.

## Usage

Respond to the prompts, the HTML page will be generated in the dist folder.
